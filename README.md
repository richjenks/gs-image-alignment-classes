# GS Image Alignment Classes

by [richjenks.com](http://richjenks.com)

Allows you to select aligned images using `.img-left` and `.img-right` in CSS.

CKEditor (the WYSIWYG content editor used by GetSimple) adds inline styles to aligned images in the form of the `float` CSS property. This prevents theme developers from adding custom styles to aligned images, such as margins to prevent text from being flat against (and list bullets from overlapping) the image.

Image Alignment Classes solves this problem by adding a class to aligned images â€” it searches for `img` elements then adds the class `img-left` and `img-right` to left- and right-aligned (floated) images, respectively.

Note that this plugin does not actually add any styles.

## Requirements

The theme must have the `get_footer()` template tag

## Installation

1. Move image-alignment-classes.php to your plugins folder
2. Enable the plugin in GS Admin

## Usage

This plugin exposes the CSS classes `img-left` and `img-right`. Example usage:

```css
.img-left,
.img-right {
    margin-bottom: 1em;
}

.img-left {
    margin-right: 1em;
}

.img-right {
    margin-left: 1em;
}
```

The CSS above solves the problem this plugin was created to solve (floated images do not have text flat against them) while allowing theme developers to add their own rules.

You could also do something like the below to hide floated images when the viewport reaches a particular size to prevent them squashing content against the sides on mobile devices:

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 30em) {
	.img-left,
	.img-right {
		display: none;
	}
}
```
